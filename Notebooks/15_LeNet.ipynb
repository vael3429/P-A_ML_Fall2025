    "In this section, we introduce LeNet, one of the earliest convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gain significant attention for its effectiveness in computer vision. Developed by Yann LeCun during his time at AT&T Bell Labs, LeNet was specifically designed for recognizing handwritten digits (LeCun et al., 1998). The model represented the culmination of nearly a decade of work in CNN research; in fact, LeCun and his collaborators were the first to demonstrate successful training of CNNs using backpropagation (LeCun et al., 1989).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it was introduced, LeNet delivered remarkable results, rivaling the accuracy of support vector machines—the leading supervised learning method of the time, by reaching an error rate below 1% per digit. The architecture was later deployed in practical applications, such as digit recognition for processing ATM deposits, and impressively, some ATMs still rely on the original code developed by Yann LeCun and Leon Bottou in the 1990s."

Unlike modern CNNs, ReLUs and max pooling had not yet been introduced at the time. Both convolutional layers use 5 × 5 kernels to transform inputs into two-dimensional feature maps, increasing the number of channels. The first convolutional layer produces 6 output channels, while the second produces 16. Dimensionality is further reduced through 2 × 2\n",

    "(batch size, channels, height, width). To connect this output to the dense block, the four-dimensional data must be flattened into a two-dimensional format suitable for fully connected layers, with one dimension indexing batch examples and the other representing the flattened features. The dense block then processes this representation through three fully connected layers containing 120, 84, and finally 10 neurons, where the last layer corresponds to the 10 possible output classes.\n",

    "In LeNet, the spatial dimensions (height and width) shrink as data passes through the convolutional block. The first convolutional layer uses padding to preserve size, while the second does not, reducing both height and width by four pixels. Historically, MNIST images were trimmed from 32 × 32 to 28 × 28 to save storage space. As layers progress, the number of channels grows (from 1 in the input, to 6 after the first convolution, and 16 after the second). Pooling layers further halve the spatial dimensions, and the final fully connected layers reduce everything down to match the number of output classes."
